Welcome to BrickBreaker ver 1.0

Getting Started:
-Pressing play sends you straight into the first level created. 
-However you can pick your desired level in the  Levels tab by pressing Levels.
-This version includes two data tracking modes: Guest Mode & Account Mode.
-The difficulty can be changed in settings. There are the difficulties: easy, medium & hard. 
-They affect the speed  of the bricks.
-Guest Mode is on by default and gets turned off as soon as you sign in or log in.
-Guest Mode only tracks your score and only refreshes once you finish all the levels or a game over.
-Guest Mode allows you to enter in a new name each time you start a new game.
-Account Mode tracks your highest score, play time and ammount of levels won and lost.
-Once an account has been made it cannot be deleted.
-Once the game has started the player may use the arrow keys or AD keys to move the paddle left or right.
-Although first the player must first press the up or W key in order to launch the ball.

ScoreBoard:

-The ScoreBoard has three viewing modes: Guest Scores, Account Scores & All Scores.
-Each viewing Mode only shows the highest 15 scores.

Fun fact: This project took me over 140 hours(possibly more) but i enjoyed every second.
Have fun!
